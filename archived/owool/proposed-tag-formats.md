#OWOOL proposed tags. 
The point of using these tag format is to
- have them available to use in the catagory page filters ( they all do not need to be used )
- get related product feeds
- generate product info automatically rather than put in product description field. ( like the current list  for gauge, weight, care instructions ) 
      this is useful for 'templating' if want to add an accordion thing or cute feature icons. 

#####~ These tags can all be prefixed with something so they do not conflict with excisting tags in your store.
