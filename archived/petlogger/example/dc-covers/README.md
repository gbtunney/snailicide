# VueFire Firestore QuickStart

A hello world create/delete demo with the Firestore NoSQL Document DB from Firebase.

## Build Setup

``` bash
git clone

# install dependencies
npm install

# Add your Firebase Project to main.js

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

## Tips

If you get a `permission error`, make sure to allow read/write access to your DB from the Firebase console.
