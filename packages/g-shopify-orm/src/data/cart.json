Order a Shade Card.\n\nWant your yarn wound into balls? Look here.\nAfter one adventurous drive in a minivan brimming with alpaca fiber, O-Wool Local was born. Since then, I've visited farms all around the Philadelphia area collecting fiber. Local is processed in the Northeastern USA. It is squishy and soft, and still has that alpaca smell and some lanolin left in the fiber. It is a truly rustic, minimally processed yarn - if that's your thing, you're going to love this yarn.\nHand wash in cold water with gentle detergent. Lay flat to dry.\n ",
