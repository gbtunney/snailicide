    "description": "Fluval FX4 is a high performance canister filter with many outstanding features designed to make aquarium fish keeping easier and more convenient than ever. This super capacity yet compact canister filter has a pump output of 700 gallons of water and has a filter circulation of 450 GPH, which both work to produce cleaner and healthier results. Filtering material can easily be placed in a removable stack of media baskets, which is at the heart of Fluval's multistage filtration. The baskets are precision-engineered to eliminate water by-pass, making filtration more efficient. The baskets can hold a total of 1 gallon of media and can be stacked in the precise combination of layers that will work best for your aquarium. Each one is lined with a foam insert for effective mechanical pre-filtering. Instant-release T-handles let you lift and separate the baskets quickly and easily, making routine maintenance simpler. FX4 also features Smart Pump Technology, which provides optimal filter performance. This advanced technological feature employs an electronic circuit board that continually monitors the pump. Impeller speed and force are constantly measured to ensure powerful output and energy efficiency. It also manages the filter's self-starting feature and evacuates air that may enter or build up within the filtration system. On a 12-hour cycle, the pump will pause and allow trapped air to escape, ensuring the best filtration efficiency. Only 16.5 inches in height, FX4 fits under most aquariums.\nFluval first broke onto the aquatic scene in 1975 by introducing the world’s first 3-stage filter with synchronous motor technology. Since then, Fluval has built a legacy around this pioneering spirit, relentlessly adapting in a changing world to launch innovative aquarium products. Fluval’s mission is not just about building products that mimic the natural world, but inspiring aquarists of all skill levels to enjoy and respect the hobby for generations to come.",

I've been keeping fish for more than 25 years. During that time I've used many different types of canister and HOB filters. My main recollection with previous canisters was the rage and frustration of priming them, fitting finicky rubber gaskets, dozens of fussy parts. . . After those experiences, the FX5/6 were such a joy. They're simple to assemble, and they prime immediately.  Nothing is perfect, so here are pros and cons to help the prospective buyer:  PROS: 1. Huge capacity. Imagine a 4-gallon bucket filled with media, with a powerful motor in the lid. 2. Moves a lot of water, and keeps the tank sparkling. 3. Starts instantly and runs like a dream. 4. Reliable - I've been running an FX5 continuously for 7 years; and an FX6 for 5 years. I've never once had any repair issues or problems of any kind. The only maintenance I do is clean or change the media as needed.  CONS (and these would probably be better described as \"things to consider before getting one\").  1. Powerful enough to suck up fish. In my 120g, I previously had jewel cichlids. They spawned, and whenever I would clean the filter I would find babies inside. Again, this is not a defect, this is just a cautionary note to be smarter than I was about where you use the filter. I currently have guppies in the 120g. They have hundreds of babies. Again, on any given day I'll find a dozen babies in the filter. (FWIW, you can adjust the flow, although I'd suggest that if you need reduced throughput, you might just get a smaller and cheaper filter).  2. It's heavy and awkward. Hey, it's a 4-gallon-ish bucket filled with water and filter media. It's heavy. As another reviewer noted, I have to heave it out of the cabinet and haul it outside to maintain it.  3. You may need to tinker with the selection and placement of filter media. A Google search will yield multiple hits from people who have suggestions and opinions on the topic. I may still be doing it wrong. From bottom to top I have a water polishing pad, two foam pads, and ceramic tubes. For some reason, the polishing pad gets saturated first, and ends up being the reason for reduced flow, while the others are only somewhat dirty. My tank is moderately planted, and I can go through perhaps 4-5 weeks between filter cleanings/media changes.  4. You'll want a towel when disconnecting the filter from the hoses for cleaning. I have not found a way to keep about half a cup of water from escaping whenever I disconnect.  5. It may take some elbow crease to depress the \"buttons\" (wrong term) to release the hose from the filter body. You have to depress them and lift the hose off, and sometimes it requires some effort.  6. Expensive. It just is. That's a lot of money to drop on a filter. But I think it's well spent. I imagine you're paying for a powerful and well-built motor. No other piece of aquarium equipment (excluding the tank, of course) has lasted me 7 years - let alone in like-new condition. I feel that I easily have another 7-plus years out of it.  Bottom line? I see no need to look for alternative filters for large tanks. I just bought a 300g aquarium, and when it arrives I will be furnishing it with another FX5 or FX6.Read more",

It’s really easy to maintain and due to its size and filtration ability I only clean mine out once very 2 months, where as with the 306, this I had to clean almost weekly.  The intake and output can both be independently adjusted, so you can reduce the flow if it’s really storing up your tank.  It came with filter media and having had this running for just over a year, I still have the original media in place and have no need to replace it any time soon. Mine came with a free gravel vac, although this was more of a novelty than a bonus. I just use a normal gravel vac as part of my water changes so the one included isn’t of any use as the water stays within the system.  After a year of constantly being on, it has been faultless but quiet it is not. There is a continuous humming noise coming from it and if the tank was in a bedroom you would not want the filter running. Keep this in mind before you buy as it is not silent. Our tank is in the living room and the filter sits in a cabinet, but it’s still quite loud, butit doesn’t bother us, however if it we’re silent running it would be an amazing and faultless filter.  It includes a small tap that allows you to drain out water direct from the filter, this makes water changes incredibly easy. However, if you’re filling the tank back up you need to ensure it’s dechlorinated water so as not to harm the fish or filter bacteria.  Other than the noise, I really can’t complain about the filter at all and would highly recommend it.  If you cover your filter Inlet with pond filter sponge, you can protect fish and shrimp from being sucked in and prolong the gap between cleaning the filter out.
