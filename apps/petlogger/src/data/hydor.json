        "body": "I have 3 of these filters now, and its hard to really say just how disappointed I am with this product. The only redeeming quality about it is that I've tried countless other filter brands and for one reason or another, they have all always failed me at some point as well. Marineland, Hydor, Fluval, you name it.  My major complaint with this particular filter has nothing to do with the filter itself and everything to do with the hose and connection points carrying water back and forth between the tank and canister. I have had leaks develop in a matter of months in all three of my filters all at various points. But all at a connection point where one of the cheap as heck red plastic washers are supposed to tighten over the hose. I have never used anything but my bare hands to tighten them down & I have become particularly paranoid about overtightening as it is such a problem with his particular brand. Yet still, just the other night I had a constant drip develop at the connection point where the output hose puts water back into the tank. I have had this same issue occur on my other filters right at the connection point that feeds into the canister itself too. It's always a slow(ish) leak that occurs so I have been able to avert disaster, but after having it happen over and over again, it's surely a design flaw. The fix could be as simple as using a metal washer! But no, then the filter might work for years at a time and you wouldn't have to continually buy new parts and products from them to keep your beloved aquatic friends alive. To be fair, these filters have always worked perfectly out of the box, it's always after a routine cleaning that leaks have developed. So I guess if you never clean your fish tank or filters, you could probably run this thing for longer without issue. But I personally need to clean my filters at least once every 3-4 weeks. After dis-assembling and re-assembling is when leaks occur. So beware!  Now up until this last leak, Hydor itself has been decent enough at replacing parts. However, this last time was a real drag. Previously all I've had to do is call them and let them know what is broken and then they send me out the replacement part. This last time I had to call, then email them with a proof of purchase, a picture of the filter sticker, and a problem description and was told that if the filter is over two years old, the part won't be replaced. Are you kidding me? Are these filters only designed to work for 2 years? What am I supposed to do when something breaks on these filters every few months? Just be out another 160 bucks? It's a sham, the only problem is no one is making a reliable product, and Hydor is at least on the cheaper end while still offering some high-end canister filter features.  It's also particularly infuriating that Hydor, unlike other companies like Marineland for example, do not offer any means of buying just the individual parts to their filter products. So when my hose breaks, I can't just buy that part. I either have to have it covered under warranty or buy an ENTIRE FILTER just to get that one piece. Talk about a scheme.  I suppose the only brand I haven't tried so far is Eheim because it's so far and away more expensive than all the rest and reading their reviews on here...they are just as prone to failure. At least with hydor I am only out 160 bucks when it fails and they haven't failed so badly to the point that I've had a massive water leak (yet) which is a positive.  Ugh, in short I guess what I'm saying is, BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.Read more",

        "body": "I purchased this over a year ago after going through many canister and hang on back filters. I started with fluval, hated the hose connections and cleaning. Moved on to marineland magnum and the bio-wheels, worked ok but getting the air out after a filter clean is a nightmare. I still use the magnum filter for gravel cleaning. The tank I use this on is a 55 gallon long glass tank. The tank houses 26 cichlids, many that are 4+ inches long , they have been my pets for about 6 years so I am really attached to them and take their health seriously and that means good water quality.  The filter sets up like most canisters, an intake hose connects to a drop pipe that ends with a strainer inside the tank and another hose connects to the output side of the canister and to a return pipe you mount on the aquarium side. There is a spray bar that you can use to return the water across the surface for better surface water agitation. I don't use the spray bar because if the water level is not kept up the water splashing sound can get sort of loud, I just have the water returning out the pipe onto the surface. Priming is easy, just push down the prime button a few times and let it fill up, plug it in and let it purge the air on its own. After it is flowing I like to lightly tap the sides of the canister to cause any air to flow out.  The filter keeps the tank clean and you can use any media you like in the baskets. I use the biological media that comes with the filter, and I use sponges for particle filtration . I don't use charcoal since I go about 3 months between filter cleanings and charcoal is only good for about a few weeks tops and then it is just a barrier to water flow with no benefit.  Cleaning is easy, just remove all the baskets that stack inside and rinse the contents in non-chlorinated water (very important or you will kill the beneficial bacteria in the filter) . When they say no bypass they mean it. I had a situation where I knocked off the strainer cap on the intake. I was cleaning the filter and in the bottom basket before the first filter media I found a surprise. A baby fish ! He was all white since he had never seen daylight, about 1/4 inch long , but healthy. He is in the main tank, has full color and is about 2+ inches now !  Noise , none, it is silent . Other than washing it out ever 2 months or so and plugging it in there hasn't been any extra cost or maintenance.  If I had to say anything bad it would be the way the tubing connects to the valves, the system works but it takes a little bit of time to put together the first time.Read more",
