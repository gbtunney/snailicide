Fasten hoses with clamping nut. There are 3 ways to prime the filter. 1) With the starter bulb (order no. 4003540), 2) with the Universal Installation Kit 1 (order no. 4004300) or 3) by sucking the hose on the pressure side. Connect the pressure side hose to the outlet elbow and the spray bar while the filter fills with water. The pump can be switched on when water has filled the filter, and for a short time while trapped air is exhausted from the filter media a slight noise from the pump will be heard (this is normal). Fit the plug into the end of the spray bar after all the air bubbles have disappeared."

But after a few weeks, the water started to go a bit yellowish again and the filter flow had slowed down to a trickle, even when I cleaned it. After a couple of months, it didn't seem very effective at all, and I went to my local fish store to look at new filters. The guy at the store asked if I was using the circular white \"polishing\" filter pad that came with the Eheim. I said I was, and he told me that the white pad should only be used if you're the kind of tank-obsessed person who cleans the filter every few days. Otherwise, because it's so fine, it gets clogged up with gunk fairly quickly and restricts water flow, so that the whole filter becomes less effective after a few days. He suggested removing the white pad and adding a 2nd coarse filter pad. I did that, and the filter has been working really well in the 4 months or so since. It keeps the water nice, doesn't leak, and is reasonably easy to clean. I'd give it 5 stars, except that I would have appreciated some better instructions that explained what I just mentioned above.

Some will tell you to suck on the outflow tube; however...you can also prime it without sucking on the tube. Here's how: You set the canister in the sink with the filter media basket in it and fill it with de-chlorinated water until it is to the point of overflowing (with the valves closed). You will see some water partially fill the intake pipe (the lower one). Then you attach the power head (the topmost part that contains the motor) and secure it with the clips. You then carry the unit to where it will remain while filtering the aquarium and attach both the intake and outflow lines. Then turn the power on, i.e. plug it in the power outlet. It takes a few minutes, and it does makes some noise while priming due to the fact that there is still some air in the lines, but it will eventually become whisper quiet when there is no more air in the lines. Then you have successfully set up your awesome German Eheim filter!

They are too similar in price and the pro 4 250 is superior in every way that I cannot recommend the 150 to anyone, unless they need a low flow rate for a 5 gallon tank or less.  This (pro 4 250) has the following benefits over the non-pro 150:  - Easier to clean due to how the hoses mechanism is designed, and how you pull the trays up and out of the filter. No drops of water all over the place.  - Much higher flow rate. This is expected, but keep in mind the price difference is negligible. Now that I've owned an eheim 150, I would never put it in anything over a 10 gallon tank even though it says its rated for 40 gallons. It's just not true if you need decent flow.  - Priming pump. My god, this saves so much pain when starting your filter back up after cleaning.  - A flow rate lever in the front top.  - The ability to bypass the white filter when it's clogged and you are waiting for a new one. This is a dial knob.  - An all in one heater of you get the \"t\" version (250t). You dont have to hang one in your tank.

They are too similar in price and the pro 4 250 is superior in every way that I cannot recommend the 150 to anyone, unless they need a low flow rate for a 5 gallon tank or less.<br><br>This (pro 4 250) has the following benefits over the non-pro 150:<br><br>- Easier to clean due to how the hoses mechanism is designed, and how you pull the trays up and out of the filter. No drops of water all over the place.<br><br>- Much higher flow rate. This is expected, but keep in mind the price difference is negligible. Now that I've owned an eheim 150, I would never put it in anything over a 10 gallon tank even though it says its rated for 40 gallons. It's just not true if you need decent flow.<br><br>- Priming pump. My god, this saves so much pain when starting your filter back up after cleaning.<br><br>- A flow rate lever in the front top.<br><br>- The ability to bypass the white filter when it's clogged and you are waiting for a new one. This is a dial knob.<br><br>- An all in one heater of you get the \"t\" version (250t). You dont have to hang one in your tank.

I have a 48\" long 75 gallon tank with 4 common goldfish and gravel on the bottom. A couple of things I've noticed so far:  Pros:  -Small footprint - I have very limited space under my stand and the canister itself has a very small footprint which is perfect for me. My old hang-on filter also took up a lot of necessary space on the sides but with this filter I'm able to place my tank closer to the wall, which is what I need.  -The little lever stoppers (don't know what they're called) on the tubing is extremely helpful for tank cleaning days, it has prevented water spills.  -I use the intake hose as a gravity pump when doing water changes - this is a HUGE pro and has actually cut my maintenance time by at least 50%, not to mention how convenient it is not to have a separate gravity pump kicking around. I'm purchasing a gravel vac for the bottom of the tank and will probably switching to sand soon as using the intake hose this way won't pick up debris on the bottom. Regardless, this is a big plus for me as I've always had problems with my gravity pump tubes getting moldy and this solves that issue.  -Strong flow rate, it's sufficient to aerate my long 48\" 75G tank but I still prefer to use an airstone on the side further away from the outtake for extra oxygen and the effect.  -Coming from a hang on filter, this one is SO MUCH quieter! My air pump is much louder than this filter and when I turn the pump off you can't even tell the aquarium is there, absolutely love this.  Cons:  -You will definitely need a long brush to clean out the tubing; my fish are extremely dirty (goldfish) and the tubes do get clogged. This isn't something unexpected however, and the cleaning is made significantly easier by the valve cutoffs on the tubes.  -I find that the intake cage has pretty wide slats in it and a lot of the excess food + fish waste gets in there and up the tube, this is both a pro and a con - it means that the filter is doing its job but the tubes get clogged easily. I'm going to pick up some mesh or pipe screens and place them over the end of the intake tube, I'm hoping that this will collect the waste in the little cage attached and make it easy for me to just empty that out.  -In my last cleaning, I handled the intake tube (at the bottom) attached to the canister rather roughly and I noticed some water leaking out of there whilst I was cleaning it (canister not running). I very gently pulled it towards me and took more care manipulating it. It's been running for 2 weeks since that incident and I haven't seen any leaking out of that area but will definitely keep an eye on that spot and maybe seal t off with silicone on the outside.

The Eheim filtration system is one of the best I've encountered. I am very disappointed to say that the quality of their filters has deteriorated over time and it seems that their warranty support is outsourced to some place equally foreign. My three year old Classic 250 filter developed a slow leak. Thanks to the fact that I use a Honeywell Home Wi-Fi Water and Freeze Detector I was notified instantly. (I strongly recommend you use a detector if a leaky aquarium could cause you substantial property damage, in addition to tank life loss.) The leak was caused by a crack in the bottom threaded connector (see photo) and likely represents poor workmanship and/or inferior materials. Now, the day this happened was the same day our city was served a total retail lockdown order due to the pandemic. I quickly realized that I could lose my 48 gallon tank, plants, fish and all if I didn't get this resolved quickly and that a local retail outlet would not be able to help. So, I used a powerhead to keep the tank water circulating and contacted info at Eheim support with the following message: \"Hello there, My Classic 250 filter sprung a leak! There is a crack in the cannister housing at the bottom threaded connector. See attached photos. This was purchased in 2019. I can't find a receipt. Our city is locked down for the next month. How soon can someone get me a replacement cannister. This is urgent! Thanks in advance.\" FIVE days later I got the following response: \"Hi, Thank you for getting in touch. Unfortunately the issue described is not covered under warranty. The part number you need is 7373010, however it is out of stock at this time, I apologize for the inconvenience. Kind regards, Nick | Eheim Support.\" WTF?? Given the urgency here, I ordered a completely new Classic 250 from Amazon and within a week I had swapped cannisters and was able to get the system up and running (I kept the old filter 'alive' by running it in a bucket while waiting for the replacement). Bottom line: great filter concept, but keep on the lookout for a better made product with better tech support.Read more",

I've seen lots of systems come and go. The Eheim filtration system is one of the best I've encountered. I am very disappointed to say that the quality of their filters has deteriorated over time and it seems that their warranty support is outsourced to some place equally foreign.
